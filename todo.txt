- Investigate this error that randomly happens from crt.sh: `Error unmarshaling JSON: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value`
- Also check the fingerprints that do not have the domain column (e.g. pantheon)

- With `embed`, do I still need to bake in the version into `create_releases.sh`?
