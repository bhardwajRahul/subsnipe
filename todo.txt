- Investigate this error that randomly happens from crt.sh: `Error unmarshaling JSON: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value`
- Also check the fingerprints that do not have the domain column (e.g. pantheon)


- To test:
    - running via docker and output json 
    - running via docker and passing in a relative path for:
        - output file 
        - subdomains file
